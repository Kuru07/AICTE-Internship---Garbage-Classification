# ðŸš€ Garbage Classification â€“ Final Week (Internship)

This week marks the completion of the garbage classification project with advanced fine-tuning and successful Android integration.

---

## âœ… Final Week Progress

### ðŸ”¹ Model Fine-Tuning:
- Switched to a more advanced transfer learning backbone to explore better accuracy.
- Increased training epochs and applied early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- Performed class balancing using class weights to address dataset imbalance.
- Further fine-tuned the model by unfreezing selected base model layers and using a lower learning rate for improved feature extraction.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Dataset Expansion:
- Experimented with increasing the number of classes using additional datasets.
- Enhanced the diversity of the training data to improve the modelâ€™s generalization.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Model Deployment:
- Successfully converted the trained model to **TensorFlow Lite (.tflite)** format for mobile deployment.
- Integrated the TFLite model into an **Android application**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Android App Features:
- Users can **select an image from the gallery**.
- The app processes the image on-device using the TensorFlow Lite interpreter.
- Displays the **predicted garbage class** along with the **confidence score**.
- Provides a fast and offline prediction experience.

### âœ… Key Deliverables:
| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Model fine-tuning with higher accuracy | âœ… |
| Dataset expansion and balancing | âœ… |
| TensorFlow Lite model conversion | âœ… |
| Android app with on-device prediction | âœ… |

---

## ðŸ”œ Possible Future Improvements:
- Implement real-time camera input for classification.
- Optimize the TFLite model for faster inference using GPU delegates.
- Deploy the app to the Google Play Store for wider usage.
- Explore cross-platform support using Flutter or Compose Multiplatform.
